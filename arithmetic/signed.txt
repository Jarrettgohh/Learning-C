=================
signed data types give the most significant bit a negative value (known as sign bit)
-> eg. for 2's complement, the sign bit is give the weight -(2^(N-1)) and the otehr value bits have the same weight as unsigned

eg. a 8-bit representation of a signed int 

|   Binary    |          Decimal              |
  1000 0000               128 (-(2^(8-1)))
  1000 0001               -127 (-(2^(8-1)) + 1)

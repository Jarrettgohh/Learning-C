1. string buffer overflow
>> strcpy, strcat, gets
>> null terminator
>> zero-byte allocation

2. signed integer overflow
>> leads to unexpected too large positive or small negative values 
-> can cause issues when the value is used in loops, memory allocation, etc.


3. Out of bounds array read and write

4. Dynamic allocated memory based vulnerabilities/issues
>> common issues
-> accessing NULL pointer (segmentation fault)
-> accessing freed pointer

>> vulnerabilities
-> double-free
-> memory leaks; not clearing memory stored in pointer address that is aleady converted to NULL due to failed call to realloc() function (refer to realloc.c)
-> reading unitialized memory

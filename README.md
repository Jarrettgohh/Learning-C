# Learning-C
Repo to store C codes while learning and reinforcing knowledge of C lang!

# To run each `.c` file
>> Using the run.sh file
Removes the need to constantly run the file with the `gcc` command, having to specify the output file path,
before executing the output file.

```
learning-c$ ./run.sh -f <path_to_file>.c
```
